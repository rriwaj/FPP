//1) The records of a database table Product have been stored in text format using delimiters “:” and “,” in the following way: Different rows are separated by “:” and, within a particular record, different column entries are separated by “,”. In each record, the first column is always productId.
//Write a program (called Prog4) that will read such a text file and extract all the product id’s that occur in the file. Your program should then output these values to the console in the following form: (this is a typical example)
//
//                   134A
//                   213A
//                   911C
//                   012E
//                   662Z
//
//           Since we have not yet discussed how to read a file in Java, a text file is provided for you
//            in this assignment named Data.txt.  The file is in our network folder. The records have
//been stored as a long String in Data.txt, named records. 
//Simply copy this long string and paste it into your program.
